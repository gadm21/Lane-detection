# Lane-detection
In this project I use undistortion and perspective transformation to extract the birdeye-view of the road, then I apply sliding windows to track lanes, then I draw trajectory that matches the found lanes shape, and finally I transform the birdeye-view back to the original perspective with the inferred  trajectory drawn
